If the generated response is highly consistent with the reference in terms of semantics, consider them similar.\nOutput:\nIf similar, output 'Yes'.\nIf not similar, output 'No'. \nNow, please judge based on the following input:\nGenerated Response: {pred}\nReference: {label}\nOutput only 'Yes' or 'No' directly, without explaining a process.",
